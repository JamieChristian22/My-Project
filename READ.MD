Project 1 – The 19th hole This project will use Excel trendlines to model the relationship between product demand and price.

📌 Objectives 
The company wants to estimate the relationship between demand and price and then use this estimated relationship to answer the following questions:
1.	Assuming the unit cost of producing a set of clubs is $250, and the price must be a multiple of $10, what price should the company charge to maximize its profit?
2.	How does the optimal price depend on the unit cost of producing a set of clubs?
3.	Is the model an accurate representation of reality?
## 📌 Key Insights
a.	**  Sell at $530 for a profit of $1042,213

b.	**Then the Price we would want to sell it at is now not $530 but $600

c.	**Yes
