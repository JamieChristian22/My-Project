## üìñ Extended Description

These visual models demonstrate key skills in process analysis, system thinking, and stakeholder communication. Each diagram was created to reflect a real-world scenario or challenge, such as mapping employee onboarding processes, identifying root causes of performance issues, or showing relationships between business entities.

Using standard BA notations like BPMN and ERD, these diagrams were developed to improve clarity and collaboration between business and technical teams. The ‚ÄúAs-Is‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo-Be‚Äù process maps specifically show my ability to assess current operations and propose improvements.

These artifacts reflect the core of what Business Analysts do: take complex systems and represent them simply, visually, and with purpose.
